In cities accross the US, bike sharing programs are becoming increasingly popular. Anyone cant rent a bike by the hour or by the day from any of the communal bike sharing stations. Washington D.C. has one of these programs.  We will be trying to predict the bike rental count for one hour time periods.

## Project: Predicting the Stock Market
##### *Link to Github Repository: https://github.com/Sharp-Data/Predicting-the-Stock-Market.git
The S&P500 index aggregates the stock prices of 500 large companies.  Every day investors make (or lose) money by
trading Exchange Traded Funds, which allow you to buy and sell indexes like they were stocks.  Creating a predictive
model to predict the S&P500 could allow traders to make money from their investments.

**Trading stocks is a risky endeavor.  Nothing in this project constitutes stock trading advice!**
